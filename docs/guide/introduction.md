# Introduction

## What is @ldesign/lottie?

`@ldesign/lottie` is a powerful, feature-rich wrapper around [lottie-web](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) that provides advanced features like instance management, performance monitoring, caching, and framework adapters for Vue and React.

## Features

### üéØ Framework Agnostic Core

The core library works with vanilla JavaScript and can be integrated into any framework. We provide official adapters for Vue and React with hooks, components, and directives.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance Optimized

- **Instance Pooling**: Efficiently manage multiple animation instances
- **Smart Caching**: Cache animation data to reduce network requests
- **Lazy Loading**: Load animations only when needed
- **Intersection Observer**: Load animations when they enter the viewport
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track FPS, memory usage, and render performance
- **Auto Degradation**: Automatically reduce quality when performance drops

### üé® Rich Configuration

- Multiple renderer types (SVG, Canvas, HTML)
- Playback control (play, pause, stop, reset)
- Speed and direction control
- Segment playback
- Loop and autoplay options
- Quality settings
- Custom event handlers
- Style customization

### üì¶ Small & Tree-Shakeable

The library is designed to be tree-shakeable, so you only bundle what you use. The core is minimal and additional features can be imported on-demand.

### üîß Developer Experience

- Full TypeScript support
- Comprehensive documentation
- Rich examples for different frameworks
- Intuitive API design
- Extensive error handling

## How It Works

    A[LottieManager] --> B[Instance Pool]
    A --> C[Cache Manager]
    A --> D[LottieInstance 1]
    A --> E[LottieInstance 2]
    A --> F[LottieInstance N]
    D --> G[Performance Monitor]
    D --> H[lottie-web]
    E --> I[Performance Monitor]
    E --> J[lottie-web]
```

### Architecture

1. **LottieManager**: Singleton manager that handles all instances
2. **Instance Pool**: Manages instance lifecycle and reuse
3. **Cache Manager**: Stores and retrieves animation data
4. **LottieInstance**: Wraps lottie-web with additional features
5. **Performance Monitor**: Tracks and reports performance metrics

## When to Use

### ‚úÖ Good Use Cases

- Multiple animations on a single page
- Dynamic animation loading
- Need for performance monitoring
- Complex animation state management
- Framework-specific integrations
- Production applications with performance requirements

### ‚ùå When You Might Not Need It

- Single, simple animation
- No performance concerns
- Direct lottie-web API preference
- Minimal bundle size is critical (though we're already pretty small!)
